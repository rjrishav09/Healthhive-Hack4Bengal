In rural areas of Kenya and Nepal, women health workers united to transform the conditions in their local clinics and community health centers.

When Asha Mwikali began working at a community clinic in Kitui, Kenya in 2008, she was immediately struck by the lack of basic resources—no consistent electricity, limited access to clean water, and overcrowded patient rooms.

“I realized these challenges had persisted for over a decade, and no one had truly listened to the voices of frontline health workers,” Mwikali shares.

In Nepal’s Baglung district, health worker Sita Rana noticed a troubling pattern—many women were silently enduring health complications due to lack of access, stigma, and limited awareness about maternal care and reproductive health.

“Women were suffering in silence, afraid to speak out,” Rana says. “They lacked information, support, and there was no system to report poor treatment or negligence. They simply stopped coming to the clinic.”

Thanks to awareness programs focusing on patient rights, maternal health education, and gender-sensitive care—supported by local NGOs and international health partners—things began to change.

“It’s so important for us as women in healthcare to stand together,” says Rana. “When we raise our voices together, especially around the health issues women face, we’re stronger and more impactful.”

Now, female health workers are trained to identify early signs of abuse, provide safe spaces for patients, and offer confidential reporting mechanisms within clinics. Women-led committees have also formed in rural hospitals to monitor and advocate for patient safety and respectful maternity care.

In Kenya, after attending leadership and medical management workshops, Mwikali helped establish the Kitui Women’s Health Alliance. These sessions were part of a global health initiative funded by international donors and implemented with the Ministry of Health.

When the local clinic was severely damaged by floods in 2021, Mwikali and her team played a key role in the reconstruction efforts—advocating for a flood-resistant design, solar-powered lighting, and better sanitation facilities.

“Today, I’m proud of the improvements we’ve made for patients and health workers alike,” says Mwikali. “Our clinic is safer, more hygienic, and even includes a breastfeeding room and a dedicated female nurse for women's health concerns.”
